# Instructions for Setting Up the Feedback System

Follow these steps to update your database for the feedback management system:

## Step 1: Import the SQL File

1. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
2. Select your database (hotel_db)
3. Go to the "Import" tab
4. Click "Choose File" and select the `update_feedback_final.sql` file
5. Click "Go" to execute the SQL statements

## Step 2: Verify the Tables

After importing, check that the `transaksi` table has these feedback-related columns:
- `rating_feedback`
- `kategori_feedback`
- `judul_feedback`
- `pesan_feedback`
- `status_feedback`
- `lampiran_feedback`
- `waktu_feedback`
- `balasan_feedback`
- `waktu_balasan_feedback`
- `id_admin_feedback`

## Step 3: Test the System

1. Log in as an administrator
2. Click on "Manajemen Feedback" in the left sidebar
3. You should see test feedback entries (if you included the sample data)
4. Try responding to a feedback entry
5. Test the "Mark as Complete" functionality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. Check the database column names
   - The PHP code expects specific column names like `rating_feedback`, `status_feedback`, etc.
   - Ensure these match what's in your database

2. Check for syntax errors
   - The SQL may need slight adjustments for your specific MariaDB version
   - For MariaDB 10.4, you might need to remove `IF EXISTS` clauses

3. Database connectivity
   - Ensure your `config.php` file has the correct database credentials
   - Check that the PDO connection is working properly

## Notes

- The feedback system is integrated with the transaction system
- Feedback entries are associated with specific hotel bookings
- Administrators can filter, respond to, and mark feedback as complete
- End users can submit feedback through the my_feedback.php interface
